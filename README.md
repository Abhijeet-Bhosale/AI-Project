Reversi Game

Reversi, also known as Othello, is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. The game starts with four discs placed in a central square, two for each player. Players take turns placing their discs on the board, capturing opponent's discs by surrounding them with their own. The objective is to have the majority of discs on the board when no more moves can be made. It's a game of skill and tactics where players aim to control and flip their opponent's discs to their color.
